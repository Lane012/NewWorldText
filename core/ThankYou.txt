Mike, 

I want to again thank you for taking the time out of your day to speak with me. After you went into more details about the QA position I feel like I have a better understanding of the workflow of the company and the responsiblities of the role. The fact that the company is becoming more quality-centric and stresses effective communication is excellent. I also like the fact that the company does sprints (thanks for explaining this) to recap and plan further goals with deadlines. QA is definitely new for me, however being able to be apart of a company that's really making education more accesible for our youth sounds amazing. The cause is what's really captivating about Openstax and being able to contribute to the success of the platform would be meaningful. 


I feel like Openstax will be an excellent way for me to utilize the skills I have gained in development already in order to learn a different craft. As you mentioned, QA will bring great insights that'll later help me bring quality to other roles like Software Development or Devops if I choose to go any of those routes. Overall, I am very excited at the opportunity of being able to work around people who are also passionate about what they do on a daily basis. 

Thanks again for giving me insight about the company and for answering all of my questions. Also, Congratulations on the Manager position! 

Best regards, 

Lane Hensley
